# Graphical

As I am learning to use various features of Android Studio this app is also made to make myself familiar with making various shapes by entering manual dimensions.

APP FEATURES:

It shows four shapes - Rectangle, Circle, Line and Triangle 

All dimensions are entered manually so that shape could be changed as per requirement.
